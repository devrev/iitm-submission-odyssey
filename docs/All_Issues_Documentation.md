## CPG-2: User Authentication Implementation

### Overview
This document describes the implementation of secure user authentication for the payment gateway, as tracked by Jira issue CPG-2. This feature is essential for ensuring the security and integrity of user data and transactions within the system.

### Details
*   **Issue Type:** Epic
*   **Status:** Done
*   **Reporter:** Isha Nayar
*   **Description:** Implement secure user authentication for the payment gateway.

### Purpose
The primary purpose of this issue is to enhance the security of the payment gateway by implementing robust user authentication mechanisms. This includes verifying user identities before granting access to sensitive resources and functionalities. Secure authentication protects user accounts from unauthorized access, mitigates fraud risks, and ensures compliance with relevant security standards and regulations.

### Next Steps
*   Review the implementation details and code to ensure adherence to security best practices.
*   Conduct thorough security testing and vulnerability assessments.
*   Monitor user authentication activity for any suspicious patterns or anomalies.
*   Maintain and update authentication protocols as needed to address emerging threats.

## Issue: CPG-3

## CPG-3: Implement Two-Factor Authentication

### Overview

This document outlines the details of issue CPG-3, which involves implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) within the CSA_Hackathon project. This task aims to enhance the security of user accounts by requiring a secondary verification method in addition to a password.

### Details

*   **Issue Key:** CPG-3
*   **Summary:** (Sample) Implement Two-Factor Authentication
*   **Issue Type:** Task
*   **Status:** Done/Complete
*   **Reporter:** Isha Nayar
*   **Description:** Add two-factor authentication for enhanced security.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of implementing two-factor authentication is to significantly improve the security posture of the application. By adding an extra layer of verification, it becomes much more difficult for unauthorized users to gain access to accounts, even if they have obtained a user's password. This is crucial for protecting sensitive user data and maintaining the integrity of the system.

### Next Steps

The issue is marked as "Done/Complete," implying that the implementation of two-factor authentication has been finished. Potential next steps could involve:

*   **Testing:** Thoroughly test the implemented 2FA functionality to ensure it works correctly and is user-friendly.
*   **Documentation:** Create user-facing documentation explaining how to enable and use 2FA.
*   **Monitoring:** Monitor 2FA usage and any related security events.
*   **Maintenance:** Periodically review and update the 2FA implementation to address any emerging security threats or vulnerabilities.
