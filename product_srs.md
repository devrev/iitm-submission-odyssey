# Product SRS Document

This document outlines the specifications for the payment gateway. A key feature is secure user authentication, critical for ensuring the security and integrity of user data and transactions within the system.

The implementation of robust user authentication mechanisms is paramount to verifying user identities before granting access to sensitive resources and functionalities. This protects user accounts from unauthorized access, mitigates fraud risks, and ensures compliance with relevant security standards and regulations. To further enhance security, two-factor authentication (2FA) has been implemented, requiring a secondary verification method in addition to a password, adding an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access and strengthening the overall security posture of the application.

Following implementation, including the 2FA component, the following steps are to be taken:

*   Review the implementation details and code to ensure adherence to security best practices.
*   Conduct thorough security testing and vulnerability assessments, including specific testing of the 2FA functionality.
*   Monitor user authentication activity for any suspicious patterns or anomalies, paying close attention to 2FA usage and related security events.
*   Maintain and update authentication protocols as needed to address emerging threats, and periodically review and update the 2FA implementation to address any emerging security threats or vulnerabilities.
*   Create user-facing documentation explaining how to enable and use 2FA.
